## Project Description

This project is made to fetch OSINT data from the network.

-fn "full name" # provides a fetch from a french phonebook that has open info about people and writes output into a result.txt file.

#example:
-fn "Jean Dupont"
```

```python
-ip "ip" # provides a fetch from internet with target IP data and writes it into a result.txt file

#example:

-ip "211.211.211.211"
```

```python
-u "username" # provides a fetch from internet with target username and writes it into a result.txt file
